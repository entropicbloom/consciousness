## 7. POTENTIAL REVIEWER CONCERNS & HOW YOUR PAPER ADDRESSES THEM

### Concern: "But these aren't real neurons"

**Counter-evidence from Entropy papers:**
- Haun & Tononi (2019): "simple simulated substrate" - ACCEPTED
- Stochastic systems paper: "mimic neural correlates" - ACCEPTED
- Brain organoid paper: Discusses artificial systems - ACCEPTED

**Your defense:** You're testing a theoretical framework about representation, not claiming ANNs are conscious. This is explicit in your paper.

---

**Counter-evidence:**
- Kleiner (2020): Purely philosophical/mathematical framework - ACCEPTED
- Northoff et al. (2019): Category theory philosophy - ACCEPTED
- Almost every consciousness paper addresses philosophical issues

**Your defense:** Information theory IS the framework. Philosophy motivates, math formalizes, experiments validate. This is Entropy's preferred style.

---

### Concern: "What about biological predictions?"

**Counter-evidence:**
- Many papers are purely computational
- Some discuss future biological work in Discussion
- Not a requirement for acceptance

**Your defense:** Your Discussion already addresses biological implications. This is sufficient.
