# Consciousness and Unambiguous Representations


## Ambiguous Representations
Representations are ubiquitous within our daily lives: Letters represent sounds, words represent con- cepts, bit strings represent files, etc. However, these representations are only meaningful insofar as they are decoded in the right way. Roman letters are meaningless to someone only familiar with Chinese characters, the word ’Utang ́atta’ is only meaningful if you know Icelandic, and a bit string representing a JPEG image of an apple only does so if the right decoding algorithm is applied. In fact, given the right decoding algorithm, the same bit string could be decoded into a sound file, a video game, a text, or any other type of digital medium. Generally speaking, there is no information inherent in a bit string that tells us anything about what it is about. For all examples provided so far, this does not pose a problem. Representations such as letters, words and bit strings are useful because we can agree on decoding schemes that should be applied for a given set of representations. Representations in conjunction with an encoding scheme bear meaning, thus rendering them useful to us. Without an encoding scheme, however, most representations are ambiguous: they could represent anything.

## Representational Accounts of Consciousness
One strategy to think about a mapping between neural activity and conscious experience is in terms of a representational relationship [^1]. If I see an apple, neural activity in my brain is representing an apple. This idea of a representational relationship accounts for the fact that the experience of an apple is not dependent on the presence of the actual apple in the real world. After all, dreams and hallucinations of apples are real phenomena. If conscious experience corresponds to the presence of representations, dreams of apples can be explained as instantiating a representation in the absence of the actual apple in the real world. But this begs the question of what encoding scheme is used to represent the visual perception of an apple in terms of neural activity.
