We conducted two experiments testing whether neural networks encode representational content unambiguously through relational structure: (1) decoding digit class from output neuron connectivity, and (2) decoding spatial position from input neuron connectivity.

\subsection{Experiment 1: Decoding Digit Class from Output Neurons}

\subsubsection{Network Architecture and Training}

We trained fully-connected networks (784-50-50-10 architecture) on MNIST digit classification under three paradigms: (1) untrained (random initialization, control), (2) standard backpropagation (2 epochs), and (3) backpropagation with 20\% dropout on hidden layers \citep{baldi2013understanding}. We generated 1000 networks per paradigm using different random seeds.

\subsubsection{Decoding Task}

Can we determine which digit class an output neuron represents from connectivity alone? Let $W \in \mathbb{R}^{10 \times 50}$ denote the output layer weight matrix (rows = neurons). We randomly permute rows to create $X$ and define label $y$ as the class of the first-row neuron, ensuring neuron position conveys no information about class identity.

\subsubsection{Relational Structure Extraction}

We extract relational structure via cosine similarities. After L2-normalizing rows of $X$ to get $X_{\text{norm}}$, we compute the Gram matrix $X' = X_{\text{norm}} X_{\text{norm}}^T$, where $(X')_{i,j}$ is the cosine similarity between neurons $i$ and $j$. This encodes relational geometry: neurons representing similar digits occupy similar positions.

\subsubsection{Decoding Methods}

\paragraph{Geometric Matching.} We construct a reference Gram matrix from multiple networks with known ordering, then find the permutation $\hat{\sigma}$ minimizing Frobenius distance to each test network:
\begin{equation}
\hat{\sigma} = \arg\min_{\sigma} \|G_{\text{ref}} - P_{\sigma} G_{\text{test}} P_{\sigma}^T\|_F
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Learned Decoder.} We trained a transformer-based decoder \citep{vaswani2017attention} with self-attention layers, treating rows of $X'$ as tokens. The architecture is permutation-invariant except for the first row (target neuron). Training used 8000 data points, validation used 2000 held-out networks, ensuring the decoder learns general relational patterns.

\subsection{Experiment 2: Decoding Spatial Position from Input Neurons}

Can we decode which pixel position an input neuron represents from its connectivity? Using the same networks, we focus on the first-layer weight matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{784 \times 50}$ (columns = input neurons). After permuting columns, we decode distance from center for the target neuron:
\begin{equation}
f(i,j) = \sqrt{(i-13.5)^2 + (j-13.5)^2}
\end{equation}

Relational structure is extracted via column-wise cosine similarities: $X' = X_{\text{norm}}^T X_{\text{norm}}$. Due to the larger neuron count (784 vs.\ 10), we use only the learned decoder (same transformer architecture, now performing regression). Performance is evaluated using $R^2$ score.

\subsection{Quantifying Ambiguity Reduction}

We compute Ambiguity Reduction Scores (ARS) to connect decoding performance with our theoretical framework:
\begin{equation}
\text{ARS} = 1 - \frac{H(I|R,C)}{H_{\max}}
\end{equation}
where $H(I|R,C)$ is conditional entropy given representation $R$ and context $C$, and $H_{\max}$ is maximum entropy.

For classification with accuracy $A$ and $K$ classes, Fano's inequality yields:
\begin{equation}
\text{ARS} \geq 1 - \frac{h_b(1-A) + (1-A)\log_2(K-1)}{\log_2 K}
\end{equation}
where $h_b(p) = -p\log_2(p) - (1-p)\log_2(1-p)$.

For regression with $R^2$ score (assuming Gaussian residuals, $\text{Var}(Y)=1$):
\begin{equation}
\text{ARS} \geq \frac{\log_2[1/(1-R^2)]}{\log_2(2\pi e)} \approx \frac{\log_2[1/(1-R^2)]}{4.094}
\end{equation}
