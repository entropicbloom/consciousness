<meta name="citation_abstract" content="This article argues that conscious brain states must unambiguously determine their representational content, formalizing ambiguity as conditional entropy. Neural network experiments with MNIST show that relational connectivity structures support measurable reductions in ambiguity, linking theoretical constraints on consciousness to empirical evidence.">
